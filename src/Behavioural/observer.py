"""
Observer pattern example

Applicability:
- When an abstraction has two aspects, one dependent on the other, and you want to reuse each
- When change to one object requires changing others, and you donâ€™t know how many objects need to be changed
- When an object should be able to notify others without knowing who they are

Consequences:
- Loose coupling between subject and observer, enhancing reuse
- Support for broadcast communication
- Notification can lead to further updates, causing a cascade effect
